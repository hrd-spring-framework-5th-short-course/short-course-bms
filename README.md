# short-course-bms

To be able to start this project:
1. just create a database name "short_course_bms_db" using postgresql.
2. Restore "short_course_bms_db.sql" script for your "short_course_bms_db" database to create some tables and data into tables. This file located at (/src/main/resources/db/short_course_bms_db.sql)

Note: If cannot restore maybe because of different Postgres username and password. My Postgres username and password is: "postgres", "root"
